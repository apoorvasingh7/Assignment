    "ANS 5: Advantages of Multithreading:\n",

    "    while performing time consuming operations. It ensures that the user interface remains smooth and interactive.\n",
    "    3.Threads within the same process share the same memory space, allowing for efficient communication and data sharing \n",
    "    between threads. This can lead to more efficient resource utilization and reduced memory consumption compared to using \n",
    "    multiple processes.\n",
    "    4. Multithreading can simplify the structure of a program by dividing complex tasks into smaller,more manageable threads. \n",

    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "    1. Multithreading introduces additional complexity to the program. Synchronization and coordination between threads need to\n",
    "    be carefully managed to avoid issues such as raceconditions,deadlocks, and thread interference. Debugging multithreaded \n",
    "    programs can also be more challenging.\n",
    "    2. When multiple thread access shared resources simultaneously, there can be resource contentions. If not properly \n",
    "    synchronized, this can lead to issues like data corruption, inconsistents results, or unexpected behaviour. Careful \n",
    "    synchronization mechanismssuch as locks or semaphores are required to handle resource access.\n",
    "    3.Each thread within a process requires its own stack and program counter, which adds overhead in terms of memory usage. If\n",
    "    a program creates to many threads, it can consume significant memory resorces, potentially leading to performance\n",
    "    degradation or even resource exhaustion.\n",
    "    4. Debugging multithreaded programs can be more challenging compared to single-threaded programs. Issues such as race \n",
    "    conditions and deadlocks may only occur sporadiclly, making them harder to reproduce or diagnose. Debugging tools and \n",
    "    techniques specific to multithreading, like thread synchroniztion analysis and deadlock detection, may be required."
